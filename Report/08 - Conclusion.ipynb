    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, our main task is to train a model that can classify the kddcup1999 dataset, a model of network security that contains a large dataset of network connections. We need to train the classifier model using the annotated dataset. In the course of the project, we first made a binary classification model, i.e. classifying connections into two categories: normal and abnormal. Then, we also used a multi-classification model to classify the abnormal connections into four sub-categories normal, probe, ur2, ddos, and r2l.\n",
